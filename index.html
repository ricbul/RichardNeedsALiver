    <p>Dear friends and family,</p>
    <p>    In June of 2022 I was advised by my gastroenterologist to begin the process of seeking major medical intervention for my liver.  The cause is an auto-immune disease known as Primary Scleroising Cholangitis.  This disease is fairly rare and effects roughly 1 in 10,000 people.  The only cure is a liver transplant.  The alternative is a miserable death and fairly soon.  Could be 3 months, couple be 3 years, but it is inevitable.</p>
    <p>    While this situation is extremely grim it isn't hopeless.  Livers are regenerative and I have chosen a hospital that has the ability to perform living donor transplants.  Finding a deceased donor in time is not guaranteed.  My Crohn's Disease and low body weight makes it more risky.  The preferred route would be to have some control over the timing and avoid the deterioration and suffering by utilizing a living donor.</p>
    <p>    All help will be much appreciated by me and my family.  <p>

    <p> If you are at all interested in becoming a donor, please follow the link below.</p>
